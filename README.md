# acemacan-final

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install dependencies and run the development server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

## Troubleshooting

### `Error: Cannot find module '../lightningcss.darwin-x64.node'`

This error occurs when the platform-specific native binary for `lightningcss` (used by Tailwind CSS v4) is missing. This typically happens when:

- `node_modules` were copied from a different platform/OS
- Optional dependencies were skipped during installation
- The `node_modules` folder is corrupted

**Fix:**

1. Delete `node_modules` and the lock file, then reinstall:

```bash
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

2. If the error persists, explicitly install the platform-specific package for your OS:

| Platform              | Package                        |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| macOS (Intel)         | `lightningcss-darwin-x64`      |
| macOS (Apple Silicon) | `lightningcss-darwin-arm64`    |
| Windows (x64)         | `lightningcss-win32-x64-msvc` |
| Linux (x64)           | `lightningcss-linux-x64-gnu`  |

```bash
npm install lightningcss-darwin-x64  # Replace with your platform
```

> **Note:** A `.npmrc` file is included in this project to ensure platform-specific optional dependencies are always properly installed.
